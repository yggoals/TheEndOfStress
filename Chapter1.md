The approach defined health as inner peace, and healing as letting go of fea. It asserted that it isn't people or events that cause us distress, but rather our own thoughts, feelings, and attitude towards people and events. The aim of the program was to help people transcend the anxiety, stress, and depression of catastrophic situations by making the fundamental shift in attitude from feat to peace. In facing adversity, it's common to relate to the stress-provoking images that a fearful mind-set perceives, not as a choice, but as reality.

Conversely, most people relate to peace as a complacent, demotivated state of mind that's emphasized once a year on holiday cards and then set aside. Peace is not generally regarded as the pinnacle of personal power, and fear is not seen as the loss of that power. Thousands of people who cam to the center for support would beg to differ. They made the shift from feat to peace in dealing with ordinary life crises, from divorce or losing a job in a bad economy to what might seem to be insurmountable challenges, such as cancer, AIDS, paralysis, or the loss of a loved one. The would tell you that the attitudinal shift from fear to peace is no small thing. It generates a change in the way you see and relate to life that can change everything. That's because attitude is the psychological force that can move you from feeling overwhelmed by circumstances to a way of being that makes you larger than circumstances. It's the last of human freedoms, bestowing the power to choose your own experience inside, regardless of what's happening outside. Master the power of attitude and you'll live a powerful life.
