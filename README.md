Downloading Course Materials

You will find multimedia links throughout most of the book, usually at the end of the chapters. These links go to specific audio files that guide you in using a tool from a particular chapter. On the final page of the book, you will find a list of all the audio files in one place and the link to the website where they are collected. There is also a link at the back of the book to sign-up for my newsletter for the latest breakthroughs in neuroscience and new stress-busting tools. You can also download the audio files, as well as worksheets, tools, and other materials related to this book at theendofstressbook.com.
