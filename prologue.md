##Point1

The approach defined health as inner peace, and healing as letting go of fea. It asserted that it isn't people or events that cause us distress, but rather our own thoughts, feelings, and attitude towards people and events. The aim of the program was to help people transcend the anxiety, stress, and depression of catastrophic situations by making the fundamental shift in attitude from feat to peace. In facing adversity, it's common to relate to the stress-provoking images that a fearful mind-set perceives, not as a choice, but as reality.

Conversely, most people relate to peace as a complacent, demotivated state of mind that's emphasized once a year on holiday cards and then set aside. Peace is not generally regarded as the pinnacle of personal power, and fear is not seen as the loss of that power. Thousands of people who cam to the center for support would beg to differ. They made the shift from feat to peace in dealing with ordinary life crises, from divorce or losing a job in a bad economy to what might seem to be insurmountable challenges, such as cancer, AIDS, paralysis, or the loss of a loved one. The would tell you that the attitudinal shift from fear to peace is no small thing. It generates a change in the way you see and relate to life that can change everything. That's because attitude is the psychological force that can move you from feeling overwhelmed by circumstances to a way of being that makes you larger than circumstances. It's the last of human freedoms, bestowing the power to choose your own experience inside, regardless of what's happening outside. Master the power of attitude and you'll live a powerful life.

To begin with, stress reactions produce stress hormones, and stress hormones disable the higher brain’s executive functions that allow you to first make a plan and then manage it through to completion. Stress hormones shrink other networks, as well, and break the connections between them, rendering you incapable of sustaining peak performance or generating the creative insight that leads to innovation. These hormones lock you into fight, flight, or freeze mode and switch your emotional set point to negative, predisposing you to feeling anxiety, anger, paranoia, and depression. They impair the immune system, wreak havoc on the cardiovascular system, damage chromosomes, kill brain cells, and, if left unchecked, will eventually kill you.

But don’t stress about it. The good news about stress is really good. There’s a solution to the problem that restores your brain so it can fulfill its mission, which is enabling you to flourish at every level of life that matters to you. This book facilitates that solution, and what makes this really good news even better is that the path to a solution is quite simple. It involves using a set of tools that nearly anyone can learn and apply and which, when integrated into your daily life, add virtually nothing to your to-do list. In fact, quieting stress reactions and amplifying higher-brain function are all about actualizing a to-be list.

At the end of each chapter I have also included a section called Your Practice This Week, where I assign practices for you to follow. After reading this section, don’t jump to the next chapter. Instead, work with the tools I’ve assigned for a few days—I recommend five days to a week—before reading the next section. As you perform your practice, review the chapter you just read to remind yourself of why the practice is important. Practicing consistently achieves the greatest change in brain function.
